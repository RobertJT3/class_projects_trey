              If you want to survive your dystopian Atlantic adventure you'll have to think and act quickly. There are substantially more threats than friends,
              however don't let that detour you! Those friends are helping from the shadows, the science that crippled the city can be harnessed for yourself,
              and even the environment seems to have your best interests in mind...sometimes.
