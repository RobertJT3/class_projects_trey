        <h1>My grumpy old lady enjoying snow</h1>
        <img src="myla.jpg" alt="German Shepard">
        <p>This is Myla, my first dog. She was a rescue at 2.5 years old, and just turned 9 years old.
            She worked very hard for her nickname by barking at eVeRyThInG for years.
            Myla guards our house well, but is the sweetest dog once you've been introduced to her.
            She loves playing in the snow, hates water, and is OBSESSED with playing fetch. 11/10 good girl.

        <h2>My spore spreader sassily laying on the couch</h2>
        <img src="tilly.jpg" alt="Golden Retriever">
        <p>Meet Tilly, the spore spreader, her shedding is eternal. She is a stage 5 clinger, and will always
            be touching a human if one is within range. Tilly loves water, and will refuse to walk under an umbrella in the rain.
            She has exactly 1 brain cell, and uses it to be as uncooperative on the leash as possible.
            9/10 good girl, would boop the snoot.

        <p>Most days Myla and Tilly play as if they are dinosaurs fighting for territory, but this photo proves
            they can be sane. Please take a moment to learn about German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers with the links below.
